# Qt Tuts for linuxNUS

These applications are written to illustrate my series of Nokia Qt C++ tutorials dedicated to linuxNUS.

They target newbies & intermediate developers. I'll start from newbies and intermediate developers first.

The ideas of the applications are original and can't be found in any books or documentation or tutorials.

You may find wiki with guides & tutorial drafts at: [http://wiki.github.com/vietlq/qt-tuts/][1] .

If you like these applications, please consider contributing comments, time and code. Thank you!
